# Anava

Anava is a game engine for rich, dynamic game worlds. It attempts to make game characters more intelligent, increase player agency, and make games faster to create.

Anava is currently in development.

**Version**: 0.1.0

## Overview

Using Anava, one can build game worlds with 'Nouns' and 'Verbs'. A character begins and ends actions, such as running, talking, or jumping. A character can be tired, then no longer tired. 

Allowing for 'nouns' in a game to change overtime with gameplay, instead of using a more rigid 'component' approach, allows for worlds to become more dynamic and volatile. Gameplay can become more based on events rather than systems.

Anava also builds procedural generation and layers of abstraction into the engine. This allows for faster workflows, as well as more dynamic content.



### Prototyping

- Anava's concept of verb based gameplay has been demonstrated in my other game, [Ordered Energy](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvODA1NTA2LzQ1ODI1NDEucG5n/original/nvwnb8.png), in which up to 63 AI soldiers can compete against one another in a web browser game at a time.

- Anava is a successor of the engine constructed of a prototype engine for my other project, Buried Peace. The source code can be viewed publicly [here](https://github.com/AlexanderFarrell/buried-peace-concept).
